# 📈 RNN-Based Stock Price Prediction

This project demonstrates the use of a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** for **predicting stock prices** based on historical market data. The model captures sequential dependencies in time series data to forecast future price trends, showcasing the potential of deep learning in financial analytics.

## 🎯 Research Motivation
Stock price movements are inherently temporal and influenced by complex patterns. This project explores how **RNN architectures** can model these temporal dependencies, supporting **data-driven financial forecasting** and enhancing decision-making in algorithmic trading and investment analysis.

## 🔍 Overview
The notebook covers the full workflow — from **data preprocessing, feature scaling, and sequence generation** to **model training, evaluation, and prediction visualization**. The approach highlights the strengths of RNNs in capturing long-term dependencies in time series data.

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- **Python**, **TensorFlow / Keras**  
- **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Scikit-learn**  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for experimentation and visualization  

## ⚙️ Execution
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bothe-amit/rnn-stock-price-prediction.git
   cd rnn-stock-price-prediction
   ```
2. Launch the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook RNN_Assg_Stock_Price_Prediction_AmitBothe.ipynb
   ```
3. Run all cells to train, evaluate, and visualize predictions.

## 📊 Key Outcomes
- Successfully modeled temporal dependencies in stock prices  
- Visualized actual vs predicted trends for performance comparison  
- Demonstrates the utility of RNNs for time-series forecasting in finance
